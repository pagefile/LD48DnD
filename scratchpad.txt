Theme Deeper and Deeper

Things that are deep
sea/ocean
space
Earth/ground

Deep trouble? Could be like a wave based shooter maybe...
deeper trouble as you go on

Roguelike space shooter? Going into wormholes to go deeper to the core
of a galaxy? Sounds kinda neat. Get some loot and power ups and what not.

I like the roguelike. Go to the core of the galaxy, travel into the
super massive black whole (that's realistic right?) and kill the boss that
is for some reason living there. It all makes sense!
(a more realistic goal for the game jam is just getting to the black hole)

Area hazards:
Asteroid fields - lots of asteroids to bump into and damage your ship.
But also lots of opportunities for loot

Pirate Sector - lots of pirates that want to kill you

Deep Space - Not a lot going on. Some enemies, some asteroids, but mostly calm

Close Encounter - close encounter with a star. Will slowly damage ship, though
there are safe areas. Risky, but could contain good rewards too.

Alien Sector - Aliens. Not initially hostile, but their stuff is good. Will
you kill them for teir technology?

Only one ship. Customizable with loot drops from asteroids, aliens, and pirates,
or debris floating in space.

Ship hardpoints: Main weapon, secondary weapon, engines, shield, armor
Main weapon is energy based with a cool down to fire.
Secondary weapon is ammo based (maybe ammo? Make it ballistic/kinetic at least)
Engines control speed and turning
shields are regnerating health on top of the hull
armor is damage reduction to the hull

multiple levels to weapons? Have a pulse laser and find another pulse laser,
does it upgrade?

What about controls?


HUD based radar ring around the edge of the screen for tracking things.
Tractor beam field thing for corraling loot. Loot that is close enough will
appear in the loadout screen so you can change out ship parts.
Loot can be scrapped to repair hull
Maybe also have an FTL drive that can be upgraded to jump farther each time.
The goal could be a distance traveled rather than a certain number of sectors.
Upgrades would let you jump farther, but them difficulty goes up quicker and you
might not have time to upgrade other components fast enough

Deep sea. Pilot(?) a submarine to the bottom of the ocean for...treasure?
Need to upgrade it as you go deeper to survive the depths and like sea
creatures or something.
