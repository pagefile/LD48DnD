Theme Deeper and Deeper

Things that are deep
sea/ocean
space
Earth/ground

Deep trouble? Could be like a wave based shooter maybe...
deeper trouble as you go on

Roguelike space shooter? Going into wormholes to go deeper to the core
of a galaxy? Sounds kinda neat. Get some loot and power ups and what not.

I like the roguelike. Go to the core of the galaxy, travel into the
super massive black whole (that's realistic right?) and kill the boss that
is for some reason living there. It all makes sense!
(a more realistic goal for the game jam is just getting to the black hole)

Area hazards:
Asteroid fields - lots of asteroids to bump into and damage your ship.
But also lots of opportunities for loot

Pirate Sector - lots of pirates that want to kill you

Deep Space - Not a lot going on. Some enemies, some asteroids, but mostly calm

Close Encounter - close encounter with a star. Will slowly damage ship, though
there are safe areas. Risky, but could contain good rewards too.

Alien Sector - Aliens. Not initially hostile, but their stuff is good. Will
you kill them for teir technology?

Only one ship. Customizable with loot drops from asteroids, aliens, and pirates,
or debris floating in space.

Ship hardpoints: Main weapon, secondary weapon, engines, shield, armor
Main weapon is energy based with a cool down to fire.
Secondary weapon is ammo based (maybe ammo? Make it ballistic/kinetic at least)
Engines control speed and turning
shields are regnerating health on top of the hull
armor is damage reduction to the hull
Hardpoints are upgraded through loot. Hull is upgraded and repaird by scrapping
loot. FTL is also upgraded through scrapping loot. 

multiple levels to weapons? Have a pulse laser and find another pulse laser,
does it upgrade?

What about controls?


HUD based radar ring around the edge of the screen for tracking things.
Tractor beam field thing for corraling loot. Loot that is close enough will
appear in the loadout screen so you can change out ship parts.
Loot can be scrapped to repair hull
Maybe also have an FTL drive that can be upgraded to jump farther each time.
The goal could be a distance traveled rather than a certain number of sectors.
Upgrades would let you jump farther, but them difficulty goes up quicker and you
might not have time to upgrade other components fast enough

Could have enemies spawn over time too to keep the player from lingering in a
sector for too long.


Story
There's a plot now!
An anomaly was detected recently emitting a range of radiation not seen from any
natural source. Accompanying this anomaly were anomalous space ships
(clever name!) that attack other ships indiscrimiately. You're mission (the
player) is to trek out into deep space and discover what this anomaly is and
possibly even put a stop to the attacks.

Progression
Jump from one system to another in order to advance towards the anomaly.
Star systems aren't targeted for jumps. Instead, the direction of the anomaly
is shown in the hud, and the player must align them selves as best they can
when making a jump. When you're close enough, there will be a certain margin of
error that is allowed when aiming, and if the player would otherwise over shoot
the anomaly, they are dropped in the anomoly's sector instead.

Fuel must be gathered to make jumps. Nebulae (I know, these are way smaller
than actual nebuae) are the safest way to gather fuel but also the slowest.
debris and derilect ships can contain fuel. Destroying enemy ships is a good
way to get fuel. They will almost always drop some. Asteroids can also have
fuel. If too long is spent in one sector, Anomalous Space Ships will warp in and
start attacking the player relentlessly, and they don't drop loot or fuel.


============================================

Sector layout
Probably going to generate points of interests for sectors in a grid based
fashion based on spatial coordinates. So say a sector is 1 square kilometer
divided into 10 square meter chunks. Each 10 square meter chunk would have a
chance of generating a POI based on a percentage determining how sparse or dense
a sector is (with at least a minimum number of POI so the player doesn't get
screwed by RNG). The POI is generated in a random spot within that 10 square
meters. The POI themselves can be prefabs, either from a library of prefabs,
or prefabs that can generate even more stuff based on what they are. The scale
here isn't final, just numbers off the top of my head, but this is a general
idea for generating sectors.
